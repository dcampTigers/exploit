A card-based game introducing threat modeling for news organizations

We are Team Tiger, and our concept was:

Question: How might we create an education toolset and approach to making security (both online and offline) to be accessible, engaging, and relevant?

Audience: Global journalists & information “relayers” in newsrooms and journalism schools.

Need: Teach & learn threat-modeling. Assess individual threat capacity.

## Solution: Tile-based game:

Round 1: Make your editorial workflow from pre-existing tiles.

Round 2: Secure the gaps in your existing workflow with limited tile flips

Round 3: Build fantasy workflow from scratch with all tiles available

## Approach:

Step 1: Send game in advance.

Step 2: Teams play game and record results

Step 3: Trainer reviews results and modifies training

# Welcome to eXploit

eXploit is a card-based exercise designed to help you understand and reduce the risks involved in telling stories some people don’t want told. 

In this exercise, you’ll be split into pairs of teams: Journalists, trying to tell stories; and Adversaries, trying to monitor or stop Journalists from telling stories. You’ll play through scenarios based on how you work now, and investigate ways in which you could make your work more secure against attackers.

The exercise should take between 45 minutes and an hour. It is not a substitute for rigorous training - instead it is designed to get you thinking about threat modeling and how it applies to you, and to illustrate that you are in control of your security and can take real steps to lessen the risks involved in your work.

You do not need your phone, laptop, or any other electronics to play through the exercise. If you want to get a head start on  learning about security tools for journalists, you may find the following links helpful:

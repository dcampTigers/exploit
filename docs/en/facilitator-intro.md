# What is eXploit?

eXploit is an education toolset and approach to making security (both online and offline) accessible, and relevant for journalists. It is a tool to help educators teach threat-modeling and help journalists assess individual threat capacity. 

The toolset takes the form of a 3-round group exercise using a card-based game, that helps participants to examine their editorial workflow and think of ways in which it might be compromised. Each round is 10 minutes, with a 15 minute discussion period at the end. The group exercise should take between 45 minutes and an hour to complete.

Minimal information should be provided to the players beforehand. This game is intended to be played as a lead-in to security training. It is not intended to provide definitive or in-depth technical knowledge - instead, it should provoke discussion and help to engage participants with security topics in advance of more rigorous training.

# How the exercise works:

The group is split into pairs of teams: Journalists and Adversaries. Each team should have 2-3 people, but if the group is small then having 1-1 pairs of Journalists and Adversaries is acceptable.

The Journalists are given 3 types of cards: People, Communication tools, and Production tools. A predefined set of each type are provided, as are blank cards of each type, to be used by the Journalists to fill in any gaps in the sets. Communication and Production tools are double-sided. An insecure version of the tool is printed on one side, with a more secure version on its opposite.

Adversaries are given a single type of card: the Attack card. These cards list potential attacks against people and tools. Each attack is rated according to its technical sophistication (stone-age to information-age) and risk of discovery (covert to overt).

The game is played in 3 rounds, exploring different scenarios. 

## Round 1 (10 mins)

Journalists are asked to use the cards to make a visual representation of their editorial workflow - the process by which they source, research, write, edit, and publish stories - using the cards provided. No more than 5 minutes should be allotted for this.  Once complete, the facilitator records the workflow by taking a picture of it.

Working independently, Adversaries are asked to pick a type of adversary. Different types of adversaries will have different capabilities and priorities. For example, a multinational corporation may have a fairly high range of technical tools available, but will prefer covert action. A drug cartel or a repressive gov will also have a range of tools available, but will be more likely to use overt methods. The Adversaries decide which attacks would be most likely to be available to this adversary, and select the matching Attack cards.

Once the Journalists have finished, the Adversaries have 5 minutes to discuss and attempt to compromise the editorial workflow at up to 3 points, using the Attack cards they’ve previously selected. The compromised workflow should also be recorded by taking a picture.

## Round 2 (10 mins)

In the second round, the Journalists may flip up to 3 tool cards to their secure sides, to harden their workflow against the Adversaries’ attacks. They have 5 minutes. The hardened workflow should be recorded by the facilitator.

The Adversaries then have 5 minutes to attempt to compromise the workflow again using their remaining cards. Their attempt should be recorded by the facilitator

## Round 3 (10 mins)

In the final round, the Journalist-Adversary pairs work together to produce the most secure workflow they can, using all available tools without restriction. They have 10 minutes. The Adversary team should discuss and decide upon at least 2 types of adversaries with differing abilities, to test the workflow under changing circumstances.

The facilitator should record the resulting workflows.

## Demo Time

To finish the exercise, each pair of teams should present their Round 3 workflow to the group, describing the choices and compromises they made and answering any questions from the other teams. The facilitator should use the digital pictures taken through the previous rounds to illustrate the presentations.

After the exercise is completed, the pictures and notes taken by the facilitator should be made available to security trainers, if any, to help them to plan for site-specific training.

# Game preparation:

The exercise cards should be printed and cut out beforehand. They’re available in PDF format <a href="https://github.com/dcampTigers/exploit/tree/master/src/cards/en/pdf">here</a>. You’ll need need at least 3 copies of each PDF for each group of 4-6 people. Some cards should be folded over as indicated on a dotted line. You’ll need pens/pencils for each team. (People never bring enough pens)

You’ll need a room with enough space for 1 table for each group. A digital projector and screen, while not necessary, are useful. If they’re not available, a whiteboard can be substituted instead.

You’ll need a digital camera or smartphone. As the teams use the game cards to create and attack workflows, you should record those workflows. 

# Playing the game:

A suggested script is provided below. Feel free to describe and run the game in your own way, according to what best suits your audience.

## Getting Started

1. Split the group into pairs of Journalist and Adversary teams

2. Distribute and explain the cards. There’s no need to go into too much detail, but make sure to point out that blank cards are available if people want to add tools or people not provided. It’s a good idea to mention the double-sided cards as well.

3. Point out that there is no such thing as absolute security, and no definitive answers - in the game or in general. The aim of the game is to provoke a discussion on security issues for journalists, and to show how to reduce the risks involved with telling stories some organizations or people might not want told.
